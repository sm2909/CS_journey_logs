# CS Journey Logs

This is a github repo where I will track my CS learning journey over the semester break after 1st year.

Following are the topics / technologies that I am trying to explore:

1. Web Development (HTML / CSS / javascript / react / tailwind css)
2. Data Structures and Algorithms
3. Haskell (Functional programming language)
4. Computer Architecture (Assembly language programming)

Awesome resources ->

HTML/CSS/Javascript: Apna college youtube videos
React: Dave gray youtube video
Tailwind css: just build a random webpage (eg. portfolio) and learn in parallel with help of chatGPT (correlating with vanilla css)

Haskell:
NPTEL course on haskell (1st half is very good for getting basics strong)
learn you a haskell for great good book (free resource available on web)
Excercism excercises for practice

Computer architecture:
Youtube playlist by Smruti Sarangi

DSA:
learn individual topics from chatGPT
