# CS Journey Logs

This is a github repo where I will track my CS learning journey over the semester break after 1st year.

Following are the topics / technologies that I am trying to explore:

1. Web Development (HTML / CSS / javascript / react / bootstrap)
2. Data Structures and Algorithms
3. Haskell (function programming language)
4. Computer Architecture (Assembly language programming)
